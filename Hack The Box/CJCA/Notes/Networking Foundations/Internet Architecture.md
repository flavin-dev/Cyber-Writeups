`Internet Architecture` describes how data is organized, transmitted, and managed across networks. Different architectural models serve different needs

## Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture

In a `Peer-to-Peer (P2P)` network, each node, whether it's a computer or any other device, acts as both a client and a server. This setup allows nodes to communicate directly with each other, sharing resources such as files, processing power, or bandwidth, without the need for a central server. 

P2P networks can be fully decentralized, with no central server involved, or partially centralized, where a central server may coordinate some tasks but does not host data.

A popular example of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) architecture is torrenting, as seen with applications like BitTorrent. In this system, anyone who has the file, referred to as a `seeder`, can upload it, allowing others to download it from multiple sources simultaneously.

|**Advantage**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Scalability`|Adding more nodes can increase total resources (storage, CPU, etc.).|
|`Resilience`|If one node goes offline, others can continue functioning.|
|`Cost distribution`|Resource burden, like bandwidth and storage, is distributed among peers, making it more cost-efficient.|

|**Disadvantage**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Management complexity`|Harder to control and manage updates/security policies across all nodes|
|`Potential reliability issues`|If too many peers leave, resources could be unavailable.|
|`Security challenges`|Each node is exposed to potential vulnerabilities.|

## Client-Server Architecture

The `Client-Server` model is one of the most widely used architectures on the Internet. In this setup, clients, which are user devices, send requests, such as a web browser asking for a webpage, and servers respond to these requests, like a web server hosting the webpage. This model typically involves centralized servers where data and applications reside, with multiple clients connecting to these servers to access services and resources.

#### Single-Tier Architecture

In a `single-tier` architecture, the client, server, and database all reside on the same machine. This setup is straightforward but is rarely used for large-scale applications due to significant limitations in scalability and security.

#### Two-Tier Architecture

The `two-tier` architecture splits the application environment into a client and a server. The client handles the presentation layer, and the server manages the data layer.

#### Three-Tier Architecture

A `three-tier` architecture introduces an additional layer between the client and the database server, known as the application server. In this model, the client manages the presentation layer, the application server handles all the business logic and processing, and the third tier is a database server.

#### N-Tier Architecture

In more complex systems, an `N-tier` architecture is used, where `N` refers to any number of separate tiers used beyond three. This setup involves multiple levels of application servers, each responsible for different aspects of business logic, processing, or data management. N-tier architectures are highly scalable and allow for distributed deployment, making them ideal for web applications and services that demand robust, flexible solutions.

|**Advantage**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Centralized control`|Easier to manage and update.|
|`Security`|Central security policies can be applied.|
|`Performance`|Dedicated servers can be optimized for their tasks.|

|**Disadvantage**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Single point of failure`|If the central server goes down, clients lose access.|
|`High Cost and Maintenance`|Setting up and sustaining a client-server architecture is expensive, requiring constant operation and expert management , making it costly to maintain.|
|`Network Congestion`|High traffic on the network can lead to congestion, slowing down or even disrupting connections when too many clients access the server simultaneously.|
## Hybrid Architecture

A `Hybrid` model blends elements of both `Client-Server` and `Peer-to-Peer (P2P)` architectures. In this setup, central servers are used to facilitate coordination and authentication tasks, while the actual data transfer occurs directly between peers. This combination leverages the strengths of both architectures to enhance efficiency and performance.

|**Advantage**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Efficiency`|Relieves workload from servers by letting peers share data.|
|`Control`|Central server can still manage user authentication, directory services, or indexing.|

| **Disadvantage**                    | **Description**                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Complex Implementation`            | Requires more sophisticated design to handle both centralized and distributed components. |
| `Potential Single Point of Failure` | If the central coordinating server fails, peer discovery might stop.                      |
## Cloud Architecture

`Cloud Architecture` refers to computing infrastructure that is hosted and managed by third-party providers, such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. This architecture operates on a virtualized scale following a client-server model.

| `3. Resource pooling`       | Share and allocate service resources dynamically among multiple users. |
| `4. Rapid elasticity`       | Quickly scale services up or down based on demand.                     |

| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Vendor lock-in`      | Migrating from one cloud provider to another can be complex.                         |
| `Security/Compliance` | Relying on a third party for data hosting can introduce concerns about data privacy. |
| `Connectivity`        | Requires stable Internet access.                                                     |

## Software-Defined Architecture (SDN)

`Software-Defined Networking (SDN)` is a modern networking approach that separates the control plane, which makes decisions about where traffic is sent, from the data plane, which actually forwards the traffic.
